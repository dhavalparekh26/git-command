Early modern India:
In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[115] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[116] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[117][118] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[119] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[120] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[119] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[121] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[122] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[120] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[120] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[123] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[124] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[124] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.
The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[145] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[146] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[147] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[148] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[149] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[149] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[148]
